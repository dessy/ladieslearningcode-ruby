        <p>A programming language is a language that is relatively easy for you to learn, but can also be understood by the computer.</p>
        <p>It's the middle ground between English and the language that the computer understands.</p>

        <h3>People vs. Computers</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you had to teach a person how to make a peanut butter sandwich.
          You might give the person an easy to follow recipe.
        </p>
        <!-- number these, 1, 2, etc. the others then become 1. a, 1. b, etc. -->
        <!-- break it down and then assemble it -->
        <!-- ruby already gives you a bit, libraries give you more -->
        <ul>
          <li>1. Toast two slices of bread</li>
          <li>2. Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread</li>
          <li>3. Spread jam on the other slice of bread</li>
          <li>4. Put the two pieces of bread together</li>
          <li>5. Put the sandwich on a plate and serve it</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
            
      <article>
        <h3>People understand GENERAL instructions</h3>
        <p>
          We left out some parts of the process, but a person could figure out:
        </p>
        <p>Where to find the ingredients</p>
        <p>To use a butter knife to spread the peanut butter</p>
        <p>To put the bread in a toaster in order to toast it</p>
        <p>etc, etc, etc (there are many little steps)</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>Computers understand EXACT instructions</h3>
        <p>
          This same recipe for a computer would be much, much longer.
        </p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <p>Firstly, a computer doesn't know what bread, peanut butter, or jam are, so you would have to define them.</p>
        <p>Once a computer knows what all of the ingredients are, you would have to tell it where to find them.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <p>
          For instance, you would have to tell it to take the bread off of the counter (after defining a counter!), 
          and if the bread is in a bag (again, defining the bag!), to open the bag first. 
        </p>
        <p>          
          Then you would have to go through the different
          ways that a bag can be sealed: if the bad is twisted, then untwist it; if the bag has a plastic fastener, 
          then take off the fastener; if the bad is tied, then untie it.
        </p>
        <p>You can quickly see how complicated the entire process becomes!</p>

        <h3>Back to programming languages</h3>
        <p>A programming language makes it easier for you to give the computer instructions.</p>
        <p>
          It's made up of simple elements, and by combining those elements together, 
          a programmer can write a set of instructions that the computer then breaks down and interprets as its own language.

        <h3>
          Why Ruby Rocks!
        </h3>
        <p>Ruby was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto, from Japan.</p>
        <p> 
          "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. 
          That is the primary purpose of Ruby language." - Yukihiro Matsumoto, 2008
        </p>
        <p>That's exactly how the language is known today by developers. Ruby is fun, it's easy to learn, and the syntax is very forgiving.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <p>This is some code in Java:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>
class Person {
  private String name, int age;

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }

  public String getAge() {
    return age;
  }
}</pre>
        </section>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <p>The equivalent code in Ruby looks like this:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age
end
          </pre>

        <p>IRB is like text messaging with Ruby. You type a message to Ruby, and Ruby responds to your message.</p>

          Numbers and Words, Integers and Strings
        </h3>
        <p>In Ruby ...</p>
        <p>Numbers without decimals are called integers. We just did some math with some integers.</p>
        <p>Letters, words, and sentences are called strings. We tell Ruby that we are intending to use a string by wrapping it in quotes.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>We call Integers and Strings Classes. That's a programming word!</p>
        <p>Classes are like categories.</p>
        <p>We just worked with the String "ladies".</p>
        <p>We say that "ladies" is an <b>instance</b> of the class String.</p>
        <p>In the same way, any other particular word or sentence is an instance of the class String.</p>
        <p>Instances of a class are like nouns in English.</p>
        <p>Let's look at some examples.</p>

        <p>Everything is Ruby is an Object.</p>
        <p>Classes themselves are Objects, and instances of those classes are also Objects.</p>
        <p>The class SimpsonsCharacter is an Object, and Homer Simpson is also an Object.</p>
        <p>The class City is an Object, and Toronto is also an Object.</p>

        <p>
          In IRB, we were used to seeing the return value of every statement we executed. 
          Remember, IRB is like back and forth text messaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you're writing a program and running it, you have to explicitly tell the program when you want it to output something.
        </p>
        <p>Modify your program with the code below, and notice the result when you run it again.</p>

          Getting Input From the User
        </h3>
        <p>The real Twitter asks you to type something, and then tells you how many characters you're working with.</p>
        <p>So far, we've just been putting our tweet directly into the program.</p>
        <p>As a programmer working on developing web applications like Twitter, you very often need to get something from the user.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>
          Asking for Input
        </h3>
        <p>The <b>puts</b> method is used for output, and the <b>gets</b> method is used for input. Try this:</p>
        <section class='build'>
          <pre>> tweet = gets</pre><pre>I'm learning Ruby with #ladieslearningcode</pre><pre>=> "I'm learning Ruby with #ladieslearningcode\n"</pre>
          <p>
            The gets method warns Ruby that you're about to speak. You can type anything you want, and it will store that in the variable tweet.
            But wait, we didn't type \n in our tweet. What is that?
          </p>
        </section>

        <h3>
          Asking for Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          The \n is there because you hit the enter button after you typed your tweet. It represents a new line, and counts as exactly one character.
          To get rid of it, do this:
        </p>
        <section class='build'>
          <pre>> tweet = gets.chomp</pre><pre>I'm learning Ruby with #ladieslearningcode</pre><pre>=> "I'm learning Ruby with #ladieslearningcode"</pre>

          Giving Output Based on Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          A lot of a programmer's job, especially when working on web applications, is doing something 
          based on the input the user provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twitter lets you send your tweet if it is 140 characters or less, 
          and tells you that your tweet is too long to send otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far we know how to determine the length of the user's tweet, but we don't know how to tell them 
          whether they can or cannot send their tweet, depending on it's length.

        <p>if the tweet is greater than 140 characters, tell the user that they cannot send their tweet</p>

        <h3>
          Your First Bug!
        </h3>
        <p>This is really a bug, since we're not actually taking into account all possible tweet lengths.</p>
        <p>Most programming problems can be solved many different ways, and this bug is no exception.</p>
        <p>
          We're going to look at three different solutions, and learn more about if statements as 
          well as comparing objects along the way.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>
          First (Worst) Solution
        </h3>
        <p>Since we're only missing one case, the case where the tweet is exactly 140 characters, we can just add another if statement.</p>
        <p>Add this last if statement to the bottom of your file: (see assignments/twitter_5.rb if needed)</p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length == 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>
          The == operator checks that the value of the objects on either side of it are equal. 
          Run your script again and notice that it catches the last case where a tweet is 140 characters long.

        <h3>
          Refactoring Our Code
        </h3>
        <p>
          Programmers are always refactoring (re-strcturing, re-organizing) their code to make it cleaner and more readable.
          Right now is a great time to do that. 
        </p>
        <p>Three if statements are unnecessary. We can actually combine all of these if statements into one, like so:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>elsif tweet.length < 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>elsif tweet.length == 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>(see assignments/twitter_6.rb if needed)</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>if .. elsif</h3>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>elsif tweet.length < 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>elsif tweet.length == 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>In the above code, if the first statement doesn't evaluate to true, then the next one is attempted, and so on.</p>
        <p>
          Only one puts statement is ever executed.
          The statements are evaluated in the order they are written, so the first one to evaluate to true is the only one executed.
        </p>
        <p>If none of the statements evaluate to true, then none of the puts statements are executed.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>
          Second Solution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our code is already better (and still has no bugs), but more refactoring can be done.
          Notice that the line puts "Tweet your hear out!" is repeated? This is unnecessary. 
          Let's cut it out by replace the entire if statement with the code below:
        </p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>elsif tweet.length <= 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>(see assignments/twitter_7.rb if needed)</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>Less than or equal to with <=, Greater than or equal to with >=</h3>
        <p>The <b><=</b> operator behaves the exact same way as the less than operator, but checks for equality as well.</p>
        <p>As you may have guessed, checking for equality with greater than works exactly the same way, using the <b>>=</b> operator.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>
          Third Time's a Charm
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is better, but look at the logic closely. Do we really even need to specify the second condition?
          Can't we just prevent the user from tweeting if their tweet is over 140 characters, and let them tweet otherwise?
        </p>
        <p>Yes we can! Replace your code again with the code below:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>else<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>(see assignments/twitter_8.rb if needed)</p>
        <p>Run your code again, and it should function the exact same way!</p>        
      </article>
      
      <article>
        <h3>if .. else</h3>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>else<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>
          Just like with if .. elsif, only one puts statement is ever executed. The difference here is that one of the
          puts statements is <b>always</b> executed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The else is there are a catch-all. You can think of it like a last resort. 
          If none of the other options are true, then just execute the puts statement after the else.

          Look at the program in puzzle_2.rb. The program asks the user for the month of their birthday, 
          and then outputs a message about the season the user celebrates their birthday in. 
        </p>
        <p>Which months does this program consider to be spring, summer, winter, and fall?</p>
        <p>
          Can you simplify the logic to make the program as few lines of code as possible? 
          Try simplifying the program one step at a time, and run it each time to make sure it behaves like you expect it to.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you start your if statement on the same line as the original puzzle (line 6), you should be able to shorten

          The <b>sleep 1</b> tells the program to wait 1 second after outputting each statement.

99.downto(1).each do |i|
  puts "#{i} bottles of beer on the wall, #{i} bottles of beer.

          If you want to output any variable within a String, you can use the syntax <b>#{my_variable}</b> inside of the String, 
          and Ruby will treat the variable exactly like a String.

        <h3>Loops + Arrays = <3</h3>
        <p>
          Every time you were looping, regardless or whether you were counting using <b>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</b>, or 
          just looping over <b>[7, 13, 14, 16, 14, 48]</b>, you were using <b>arrays</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An array is simply a collection of objects. Loops are used to move from one element of an array to another.

        <p>2. For each colour, asks the user if it is their favourite.</p>

          5. Once the loop is complete, if the user said yes to a colour, the program outputs their favourite colour to them.
          If the user did not say yes to any of the colours, it tells them that their favourite colour is not red, green, blue, or yellow.

        <p>At the start of the game, the player and the dealer each get 2 cards.</p>

          The player is told the sum of their two cards, and then has the opportunity to type h

          If the player manages to make it through the hitting cycle without winning or losing, the dealer
          receives cards until their sum is greater than or equal to 17.
        </p>
        <p>The sum of the player's cards and the sum of the dealer's cards are compared.</p>
        <p>If the dealer's sum is greater than 21, then the player wins.</p>
        <p>Otherwise if the player's sum is greater than the dealer's sum, then the player wins.</p>
        <p>Otherwise if the player's sum is equal to the dealer's sum, then there is a tie.</p>
