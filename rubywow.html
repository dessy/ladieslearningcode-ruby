        <h3>
          The Dilemma
        </h3>
        <p>Your computer speaks a language called assembly.</p>
        <p>You can interact with you computer using your mouse and your keyboard.</p>
        <p>You don't speak assembly, and assembly is really difficult for a person to speak, so learning isn't really an option.</p>
        <p>However, you do need a way to tell your computer to do things.</p>

        <h3>
          The Solution
        </h3>
        <p>A programming language is a language that is relatively easy for you to learn, but can also be understood by the computer.</p>
        <p>It's the middle-ground between English and assembly.</p>
        <p>A programming language is made up of simple elements, and by combining those elements together, 
          a programmer can write a set of instructions that the computer then breaks down and interprets as assembly.</p>

          You've just learned what programming is!

            If you're familiar with Twitter, you're probably starting to get a sense of how Twitter knows 
            how many characters you've typed in.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll play with this some more shortly. First, let's talk about what we just learned.

            How did Ruby know to add the numbers together, and to concatenate all of the words into one long word?

            Ruby knows the difference between a number and a word.

          Numbers and Words, Integers and Strings
        </h3>
        <p>In Ruby ...</p>
        <p>Numbers without decimals are called integers. We just did some math with some integers.</p>
        <p>Letters, words, and sentences are called strings. We tell Ruby that we are intending to use a string by wrapping it in quotes.</p>
        <p>You've just met your first two types of Objects. That's a programming word!</p>

        <p>
          Data can be a word, a sentence, an integer, a decimal, a collection of integers, or anything else that you would traditionally think of as data.
        </p>
        <p> Type is just the kind of data that you're providing. The two you've met so far are Integer and String.</p>

        <h3>
          Objects, Objects, Everywhere!
        </h3>
        <p>Objects are everywhere in Ruby.</p>
        <p>You can think of an Object in the Ruby language the same way you can think of a noun in the English language.</p>
        <p>A noun is a person, place, or a thing.</p>
        <p>The objects we worked with earlier, the Integer 2, or the String "ladieslearningcode", are things.</p>
        <p>Objects are represented by a Class. That's another programming word!</p>
        <p>Let's look at an example.</p>

        <h3>
          Classes
        </h3>
        <p>Going back to the English language and nouns ...</p>
        <p>Lisa Simpson is a noun. Lisa Simpson is a type of cartoon character.</p>
        <p>In Ruby, Lisa Simpson would be an object, and the Class representing Lisa would be CartoonCharacter.</p>
        <p>Now back to an object we've used ...</p>
        <p>"ladieslearningcode" is an object, and the Class representing that object is String. Want proof? Try this:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>"ladieslearningcode".class<br>=> String</pre>

        <h3>
          Methods
        </h3>
        <p>capitalize, upcase, reverse, and length are all methods that you can call on a String.</p>
        <p>When you call the method capitalize, you're telling the String to do something.</p>
        <p>Methods are actions. You can compare methods in Ruby to verbs in English.</p>
        <p>In English, you would tell Lisa Simpson to read a book. In Ruby, you would call the read_book method on lisa.</p>

          <p>Oops. Capitalizing the number 5 just doesn't make sense.</p>
          <p>
            Let's look at that error message. A developer (even the best of the best) spends a lot of time reading error messages.

        <h3>
          Putting it all together
        </h3>
        <p>Some methods don't make sense on certain objects.</p>
        <p>The capitalize method makes sense on the String "ladieslearningcode" but does not make sense on the Integer 5.</p>
        <p>That's why 5 does not <b>respond to</b> the method capitalize.</p>
