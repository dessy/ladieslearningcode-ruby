        <h3>
          The Dilemma
        </h3>
        <p>Your computer speaks a language called machine language.</p>
        <p>You can interact with you computer using your mouse and your keyboard.</p>
        <p>You don't speak machine language, and machine language is really difficult for a person to speak, so learning isn't really an option.</p>
        <p>However, you do need a way to tell your computer to do things.</p>

        <h3>
          The Solution
        </h3>
        <p>A programming language is a language that is relatively easy for you to learn, but can also be understood by the computer.</p>
        <p>It's the middle-ground between English and machine language.</p>
        <p>A programming language is made up of simple elements, and by combining those elements together, 
          a programmer can write a set of instructions that the computer then breaks down and interprets as machine language.</p>

        <p>Numbers without decimals are called integers. We just did some math with some integers.</p>
        <p>Letters, words, and sentences are called strings. We tell Ruby that we are intending to use a string by wrapping it in quotes.</p>

        <p>Objects are everywhere in Ruby.</p>
        <p>You can think of an Object in the Ruby language the same way you can think of a noun in the English language.</p>
        <p>A noun is a particular person, place, or a thing.</p>
        <p>The objects we worked with earlier, the Integer 99, or the String "ladieslearningcode", are things.</p>
        <p>Objects are represented by a Class. That's another programming word!</p>

        <p>So far, we've just been putting our tweet directly into the program.</p>
        <p>As a programmer working on developing web applications like Twitter, you very often need to get something from the user.</p>

        <p>Ask (politely!) for a tweet from the user.</p>
        <p>Output the tweet the user gave.</p>
        <p>Output the number of characters in the tweet.</p>

        <h3>
          Giving Output Based on Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          A lot of a programmer's job, especially when working on web applications, is doing something 
          based on the input the user provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twitter, for example, disables the Tweet button if your tweet is over 140 characters, 
          and keeps the button enabled if your tweet is 140 characters or shorter.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far we know how to determine the length of the user's tweet, but we don't know how to tell them 
          whether they can or cannot send their tweet, depending on it's length.

          Programming is writing out sets of simple instructions for the computer to follow. 
          Let's break down out tweet logic into simple instructions. Here is what we want our program to do:
        </p>
        <p>if the tweet is greater than 140 characters, tell the user that they cannot send their tweet</p>
        <p>if the tweet is less than or equal to 140 characters, tell the user that they can send their tweet</p>

        <h3>
          Your First Bug!
        </h3>
        <p>This is really a bug, since we're not actually taking into account all possible tweet lengths.</p>
        <p>Most programming problems can be solved many different ways, and this bug is no exception.</p>
        <p>
          We're going to look at three different solutions, and learn more about if statements as 
          well as comparing objects along the way.

        <h3>
          First (Worst) Solution
        </h3>
        <p>Since we're only missing one case, the case where the tweet is exactly 140 characters, we can just add another if statement.</p>
        <p>Add this last if statement to the bottom of your file:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length == 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>

          The == operator checks that the value of the objects on either side of it are equal. 
          Run your script again and notice that it catches the last case where a tweet is 140 characters long.

        <h3>
          Refactoring Our Code
        </h3>
        <p>
          Programmers are always refactoring (re-strcturing, re-organizing) their code to make it cleaner and more readable.
          Right now is a great time to do that. 
        </p>
        <p>Three if statements are unnecessary. We can actually combine all of these if statements into one, like so:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>elsif tweet.length < 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>elsif tweet.length == 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>
          If the first if doesn't evaluate to true, then the next one is attempted, and so on.
          TODO: Talk about the details of this. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Second Solution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our code is already better (and still has no bugs), but more refactoring can be done.
          Notice that the line puts "Tweet your hear out!" is repeated? This is unnecessary. 
          Let's cut it out by replace the entire if statement with the code below:
        </p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>elsif tweet.length <= 140<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>The <= operator behaves the exact same way as the less than operator, but checks for equality as well.</p>
        <p>As you may have guessed, checking for equality with greater than works exactly the same way, using the >= operator.</p>

        <h3>
          Third Time's a Charm
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is better, but look at the logic closely. Do we really even need to specify the second condition?
          Can't we just prevent the user from tweeting is their tweet is over 140 characters, and let them tweet in all other cases?
        </p>
        <p>Yes we can! Replace your code again with the code below:</p>
        <section>
          <pre>if tweet.length > 140<br>  puts "Your tweet is too long!"<br>else<br>  puts "Tweet your heart out!"<br>end</pre>
        </section>
        <p>Run your code again, and it should function the exact same way!</p>

        <p>
          Look at the program in puzzle_2.rb. The program asks the user for the month of their birthday, 
          and then outputs a message about the season the user celebrates their birthday in. 
        </p>
        <p>Which months does this program consider to be spring, summer, winter, and fall?</p>
        <p>
          Can you simplify the logic to make the program as few lines of code as possible? 
          Try simplifying the program one step at a time, and run it each time to make sure it behaves like you expect it to.
