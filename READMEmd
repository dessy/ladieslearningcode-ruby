# Learning to Program With Ruby

This content was designed for [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/), with the intention 
of teaching introductory programming concepts to people of all ages who have had no previous programming experience. 
It's meant to be used along with the assignments, worksheets, and puzzles provided.

I've used this content at two [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/) workshops. 
The workshops were both a full day (approximately 7 hours). If you have any questions about using this 
content yourself, you can absolutely get in touch with me and I'll be happy to share my experiences with you.

Feedback is more than welcome, and in fact very much appreciated!

# Thanks

A big thank you to [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/), as well as all of the volunteers 
and mentors who support the organization.
