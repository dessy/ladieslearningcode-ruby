What is Ruby?
- A programming language
- Talk to your computer via a programming language

Starting the console (OS X)
- Applications -> Terminal

Starting the console (Windows)
- Click 'Start' -> 'All Programs' -> 'Accessories' -> 'Command Prompt' (C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe)

Integers
- Numbers without decimals

Running ruby
- Type ruby -v
- You should see ruby 1.9.2p290 followed by other information
- Type irb to enter the ruby console
- Type 1 + 1
- See the result 2 printed to the screen
- Try this again with any other integers
- Type 2 * 5
- You can see the Ruby can perform calculations
- You've just met your first data type! An integer. 

What are data types?
- Look at the two words separately: data and type
- Data can be a word, a collection of words, a number, an integer, a decimal, or anything you would traditionally think of as data
- Type refers to the kind of data that is provided; important because you have to be able to tell the computer what you expect to be able to do with the data you provide it
- For instance, try typing 1 + 5 and then try typing 'ladies' + 'learning' + 'code'
- Let's break down the two statements you just typed
- Each one is made up of data and an operator
- The data between the first and second is different; in the first statement you're using numbers, and in the second words
- The operator in the first and second statement is the same, the + operator
- Notice that Ruby did two different things with the data provided, using the same operator. How did ruby know what to do with the data provided?
- The data has a type, and depending on the type, Ruby knows what to do with the data provided when an operator is applied to it. 
- In the first statement, the data types of 1 and 5 is Integer, and in the second, the words are all of type String
- Integer and String are only two of several data types in Ruby. We'll cover more a bit later on. 

Writing a script and running it from the console

Ruby I/O
- Basic user input/outut

Logic
- Basic logic
